# 🔐 Secure File Decryption Guide

This repository contains encrypted files and encryption/decryption code.
The original files can be decrypted only if you have the correct private key
and the password used to protect it.

---

## 🧠 How the Security Model Works

This project uses modern cryptography:

- AES-256-GCM for file encryption (confidentiality + integrity)
- RSA-4096 public key encryption for the AES key
- The private key is encrypted with a password

To decrypt a file, you must have BOTH:
1. The private key file
2. The password

The password alone is not sufficient.
The private key alone is not sufficient.

## 📦 What Is Stored in This Repository

Safe to store on GitHub:

- Encrypted files (e.g. CryptoSeedPhrase.txt.enc)
- Public key (public.key)
- Source code
- This README

---

## 🚫 What Is NOT Stored in This Repository

For security reasons, the following are never committed:

- private.key
- password
- decrypted files

These must be obtained securely, stored locally and do not alter private key, public key, and encrypted file in any case.

## 🔑 What You Need to Decrypt a File

Before decrypting, make sure you have:

1. Encrypted file (CryptoSeedPhrase.txt.enc)
2. Private key file (private.key)
3. The password used to protect the private key

---

## 📁 Where to Store the Private Key

Store the private key outside the Git repository.

## ▶ How to Decrypt a File

1. Compile the project:
javac -d out src/**/*.java

2. Run the program:
java -cp out Main

3. Output:
CryptoSeedPhrase_decrypted.txt

If the password or private key is incorrect, decryption will fail safely.

## 🚨 Common Errors

Authentication tag mismatch:
- Wrong password
- Wrong private key
- File was modified

BadPaddingException:
- File tampered or incorrect key

InvalidKeySpecException:
- Corrupted private key file

File not found:
- Incorrect private key path

## 🆘 Help

If decryption fails:
1. Verify the private key file
2. Verify the password
3. Ensure the encrypted file was not modified
